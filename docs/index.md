# Welcome to My Git-Related Docs

I have created several user guides about Git and TortoiseGit which are essential tools I use to manage documentation repos. 

These guides were created in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) and generated with [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org).

[My GitHub Repo for these documents](https://github.com/jc-johnson/my-docs-github).
